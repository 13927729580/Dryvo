Dryvo is a unique solution for the driving lessons industry. Our aim is to save the teacherâ€™s time and to increase revenues, and for the students to have control on the entire process. Dryvo is changing the way driving lessons are being managed.

### The problem

Teachers spend most of their time dealing with phone calls from students, scheduling lessons and planning their routes and topics for each student. Students are having a hard time keeping track of their payments, lessons, and progress. They usually have no idea when they are ready for a driving test or what topics they will be learning next.

### The solution

Dryvo is a platform for driving lessons scheduling and management. We aim for teachers and students to have control on the entire process - from co-scheduling lessons to tracking payments and topics. Students can track their progress, see what topics they have learned and control their payment balance. Teachers, on the other hand, can focus on each lesson without having to worry about scheduling lessons or dealing with payments ahead.
In addition to the easier interaction service we offer, we plan on adding many more features - smart lessons scheduler, where the machine will know the teacher preferences and can automatically decide lesson times. Moreover, an efficient route-planner so the teacher can save valuable time and cut on gas expenses.

## Key features

-   Smart schedule which takes the following into account:
    -   Student & appointments locations
    -   Traffic
    -   Users requirements
    -   Internal rules taught by dozens of teachers
-   Lesson tracking
-   Payments tracking
